**ADVICE FOR ARRESTEE SUPPORT CALLERS**

Thanks so much for being part of this project! We think it's a really important role, to remind arrestees that we appreciate them and care about them, to allow them to debrief a little and tell their story, and to gain feedback on what the experience for them is like and where the holes are.

Tl;dr be a warm empathetic listener, be yourself, and take care of yourself in this work.

Our goal is to make the conversation succinct enough to fit into a ~15 minute phone call but as we are still testing, going longer for more information is super duper OK! Some have been around 30 mins in this testing phase.

Although there is an order to the questions, sometimes the person will add extra info which effectively answers the questions out of order. It's great to be familiar with the whole survey going in to the call so that you can jump around a bit with your data entry if that happens.

In general, keep your side of the chat to a minimum and listen empathetically. They might have lots to say, and we want to hear it! If they sound a little antsy or bored, do check in as to how they're going and whether they wish to continue.

And take breaks! It can be full on holding all this information and listening in a  focussed way for 30 mins - it's tiring! Look after yourself, take breaks, only make as many calls per day as you feel comfortable with.

Thanks again!!

Love and rage, the UX Arrestee Support Project

**PREAMBLE**

Hi there, I’m X from the Arrestee Support team. We’re touching base with people who were involved in the Spring Rebellion, particularly those who had an interaction with police. I understand that might have been your situation? Great! So we’re collecting a bit of information from everyone we touch base with. I’ll be writing notes from our conversation. Your data will be held by a small and transparent group of XR rebels in the legal, arrestee support, and User Experience and Regen Working Groups. Is that ok?

[If they are particularly concerned about security, they will mention at this point. Record as security conscious if so. Give the legal number if they wish to be able to get in touch. Record this at the bottom of the survey.]

**If they are worried or uncertain about being involved**: The reason we’re making these calls is to make sure arrestees know what support is available, know that legal help is available, and some financial assistance is available.The type of support which is available is still being developed. We can’t promise you the world but we can connect you up as best we can and keep in touch!

This is also to make sure that you have the chance to debrief a bit and give any feedback you’d like to give.
