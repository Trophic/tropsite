<strong>ADVICE FOR ARRESTEE SUPPORT CALLERS</strong>
</p>
<p>
Thanks so much for being part of this project! We think it's a really important role, to remind arrestees that we appreciate them and care about them, to allow them to debrief a little and tell their story, and to gain feedback on what the experience for them is like and where the holes are.
</p>
<p>
Tl;dr be a warm empathetic listener, be yourself, and take care of yourself in this work.
</p>
<p>
Our goal is to make the conversation succinct enough to fit into a ~15 minute phone call but as we are still testing, going longer for more information is super duper OK! Some have been around 30 mins in this testing phase.
</p>
<p>
Although there is an order to the questions, sometimes the person will add extra info which effectively answers the questions out of order. It's great to be familiar with the whole survey going in to the call so that you can jump around a bit with your data entry if that happens.
</p>
<p>
In general, keep your side of the chat to a minimum and listen empathetically. They might have lots to say, and we want to hear it! If they sound a little antsy or bored, do check in as to how they're going and whether they wish to continue.
</p>
<p>
And take breaks! It can be full on holding all this information and listening in a  focussed way for 30 mins - it's tiring! Look after yourself, take breaks, only make as many calls per day as you feel comfortable with.
</p>
<p>
Thanks again!!

<strong>PREAMBLE</strong>
</p>
<p>
Hi there, I’m X from the Arrestee Support team. We’re touching base with people who were involved in the XR action, particularly those who had an interaction with police. We’re doing follow-up calls now that usually take about 15mins, in collaboration with the XR Legal and Regen team. I understand that you may have had an interaction with the police? OK Have you got some time now to talk or can we reschedule?
</p>
<p>
How are you feeling?
</p>
<p>
So we’re collecting a bit of information from everyone we touch base with. I’ll be writing notes from our conversation. Your data will be held by a small and transparent group of activists in the arrestee support skills group. We will ask for your permission before we share this with Rob Stary and MALS.
</p>
<p>
This is also to make sure that you have the chance to debrief a bit and give any feedback you’d like to give.
</p>
